## Project Description
Substance abuse is a major problem in the United States, with an estimated 21.2 million Americans aged 12 or older struggling with substance use disorder in 2020. Of those individuals, only 4.2 million received any type of treatment for their addiction. There are a variety of substance abuse treatment programs available throughout the country, including outpatient counseling, residential treatment centers, and medication-assisted treatment. In 2021, there were approximately 14,000 specialized substance abuse treatment facilities in the US, serving over 1.3 million people. However, there are still significant barriers to accessing treatment, including lack of insurance coverage, stigma, and limited availability of services in certain areas. Despite these challenges, substance abuse treatment programs remain a critical component of addressing the ongoing addiction crisis in the United States.

In this project, we are primarily interested in understanding the reasons for program non-completion so that recommendations could be made to improve the completion rate for treatment facilities across the United States. When considering the reasons for program non-completion, two main cases stand out as having government, policy-related, or systematic reasons for occurrence: Dropouts and Transfers. Therefore, we seek to understand, for both events, who is dropping out or transferring and why. The main goal of this project is to make recommendations on how to ensure individuals who enter the substance abuse system are successful and complete their program on the first try.
